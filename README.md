Who I Am
As a Software Engineering Apprentice, I'm energized by the challenge of problem-solving and crafting innovative software. I've built a solid coding foundation through a comprehensive 12-month apprenticeship with Multiverse, where I received robust training, and gained invaluable practical experience during my placement at Verizon. My commitment to continuous improvement drives my hands-on learning approach. My strong passion for Artificial Intelligence has led to significant practical experience with various AI models, including Ollama (leveraging Mistral and Llama3), and VEGAS (utilizing Gemini), where I successfully developed and implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat system.

Why I Do What I Do
I am deeply passionate about software development because I thrive on the intellectual challenge of solving complex problems and the creative satisfaction of building efficient, innovative solutions. My particular interest in Artificial Intelligence stems from its immense potential to transform industries and enhance human capabilities, driving me to gain practical experience in this cutting-edge field. I am committed to continuous learning and applying technology to create meaningful impact.
