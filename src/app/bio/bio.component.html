            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>As a Software Engineering Apprentice, I'm energized by the challenge of problem-solving and crafting innovative software. I've built a solid coding foundation through a comprehensive 12-month apprenticeship with Multiverse, where I received robust training, and gained invaluable practical experience during my placement at Verizon. My commitment to continuous improvement drives my hands-on learning approach. My strong passion for Artificial Intelligence has led to significant practical experience with various AI models, including Ollama (leveraging Mistral and Llama3), and VEGAS (utilizing Gemini), where I successfully developed and implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat system.</p>
